# Wikipedia Viewer

This small interactive page allows the user to get a list of Wikipedia
articles by entering a query into an input. They can also be redirected
to a "random" wikipedia article at the click of a button.

In this task, I hope to fulfill the following to go above and beyond the
initial task and push my working knowledge.

* I am looking to make a pleasent user interface.
* The UX will include some animation work
* Must be responsive
* Can use a framework, beit Angular/Vue/React.

This task is part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer)
course. I will try to go beyond the tasks to push my current
understanding.
